# We can do many more things with rules.
# One of them is aggregation.

[?driver, :hasRaceCount, ?raceCount] :-
    AGGREGATE(
        [?driver, :hasRacedIn, ?race]
        ON ?driver
        BIND COUNT(?race) AS ?raceCount
        ) .
# Notice that we are using the previously 'inferred' property :hasRacedIn
#Â Now we can use this property in queries too of course, to make them faster and more readable.
