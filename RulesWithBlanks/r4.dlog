#Â Now we can also look at negation as failure, another very powerful feature of rules
# Let's find out if a driver has never been on the podium

# First, we'll use a rule to determine if a result is 'in the podium places'.
[?___, a, :PodiumPlaceResult] :-
    [?___, :results_positionOrder, ?___],
    FILTER(?___ < 4) .

# Then we look for drivers, who have no :PodiumPlaceResult.
[?driver, a, :DriverWithoutPodiums] :-
    [?driver, a, :drivers],
    NOT EXISTS ?result IN (
        [?result, :results_driver, ?driver],
        [?result, a, :PodiumPlaceResult]) .
